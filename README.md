# Scrapify

## Overview
This project aims to create a web application that collects product information from various online stores and performs several operations on the collected data. The application will allow users to:

* **View all collected data:** A main page will display all the scraped product information, including a section for product recommendations based on search history.
* **Apply sorting and filtering:** Users can sort and filter the products based on various criteria, such as keywords, store origin, and price.
* **Access product details:** Each product will have a dedicated page that displays more detailed information. This page will also include recommendations for similar products.
* **Search history:** Every viewed product will be added to the user's search history, which will be used to generate personalized product recommendations.

## Technologies
* **Django:** The backend framework for building the web application.
* **Beautiful Soup:** For web scraping to extract product data from various online stores.
* **Whoosh:** A fast, pure-Python search engine library for indexing and searching the collected data.
* **Recommendation Systems:** For providing personalized product recommendations based on user behavior.

## Features
* **Data Collection:** Scrapes product information from multiple online stores.
* **Data Storage:** Stores the scraped data in a structured format for efficient querying.
* **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for products using keywords, filters, and sorting options.
* **Product Details:** Provides detailed information for each product, including images, descriptions, and prices.
* **Recommendation System:** Generates personalized product recommendations based on user search history and product similarity.
* **User Interface:** A user-friendly web interface for interacting with the application.

**Note:** This is a basic outline of the project. Specific implementation details will vary based on the chosen technologies and the complexity of the target online stores.
